1) Explain the components of the JDK.
   => 
      1.it contains java development tools(javap , javac),
      	API set ,Documentation
      	supporting libraries(rt.jar,src.zip),
      	runtime envirnment (like JVM).
      2.it conatins JRE & Developmet tools
      3.JRE Contains JVM

2) Differentiate between JDK, JVM, and JRE.
   =>
      1.JDK :
        -it contains both JRE & JVM
         it provides all toolset, to develop.run,design java applicnation
        -its platform dependent
        
        
      2.JRE : 
        -it contains JVM , supporting lirbaries to run java applicn
         API's Set , all packges
        - its platform dependent

      3.JVM :
        it conatins class loaders , method ares , excution engine
        to run java application
       - its platform dependent

3) What is the role of the JVM in Java? & How does the JVM execute Java code?
   =>
   - Its role to run byte code(.class file code)
   -it has class loader, which loads byte file into method areas,
   -then gives JIT compiler to runs code.


4) Explain the memory management system of the JVM.
  =>
  - it has method area, stack area , heap area,native area , pc registers, to store data, and instruction
  - method area : stores class level data , static data
  - stack : stores local varibles , running methods
  - heap : stores arrays , instance variables, dynamic datas
  - pc register : stores address of next executing instruction
  - native areas :  stores data of another languages like c ,c++

5) What are the JIT compiler and its role in the JVM? What is the bytecode and why is it important for Java?
  => JIT : Just In Tme compiler
     - it makes JVM faster
     - it saves repeating methods into machine codes
       next time doesnt execute same code , will give saved o/p.
     
     Byte code :  after compilation of source code , we get compiled code
      that's byte code...
      - its platform independent
      - so same compiled code we can run on any platform having JVM
      - it makes java platform independent.


6) Describe the architecture of the JVM.
   =>
   JVM consist of :
   1.Loading :
 -------------------
   1.Class Loader :
   		    -which loads .class file in memory
   2.verification :
                    -checks byte code is correct or wrong , is cmpiled in right language or not, if it wrong then gives exception
  	            -replces static varibles with default values
                    -replaces symbols with codes
   3.resolution :   
                    -executes static data top to bottom
                    -gives original values to static varibles

  2. Method areas :
 -------------------------
   1.it has method area, stack area , heap area,native area , pc registers, to store data, and instruction
   2.method area : stores class level data , static data
   3.stack : stores local varibles , running methods
   4.heap : stores arrays , instance variables, dynamic datas
   5.pc register : stores address of next executing instruction
   6.native areas :  stores data of another languages like c ,c++
 
  3.Execution Engine:
----------------------------
    JIT : Just In Tme compiler
     - it makes JVM faster
     - it saves repeating methods into machine codes
       next time doesnt execute same code , will give saved o/p.
   
     
7) How does Java achieve platform independence through the JVM?
  =>
    -JVM is software which runs java applcation
    -JVM understands byte code
    -compiled code (byte code) , JVM runs this code
    -and its platform independent,
    -JVM understands this , if its compiled on any platform , this code will be in same aseembily object oriented code
    -so jvm runs this , 
    -if any platoform has JVM , that platform will understand it .

  
8) What is the significance of the class loader in Java? What is the process of garbage collection in Java.
  =>
  1.Class Loader :
-----------------------
   		    -which loads .class file in memory
  2.Garbage Collection:
-----------------------
                    -Garbage Collector is software in execution engine , in JVM.
                    -its work is , if any object is not pointing to any location , delete this object 
                     called garbage collection.
